### Question and problem definition

Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.

We need to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the Kaggle competition description page [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
Here are the highlights to note:
 push
    i.) On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.
    
    ii.) One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.
    
    iii.) Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.
